# devOpsAcademy - Exercise 3

This time we create a fully functional Jenkins instance over AWS. The running instance is under http://34.195.111.166/ the credentials will be provided through email to not add it to the repo.

This running version has a job already created. I'm using this same repo to download the script listContent.sh.
